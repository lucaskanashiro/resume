abstract="Password policies -- documents which regulate how users must create, manage, and change their passwords -- can have complex and unforeseen consequences on organizational security. Since these policies regulate user behavior, users must be clear as to what is expected of them. Unfortunately, current policies are written in language that is often ambiguous. To tackle ambiguity, we previously developed a formal language for stating what behavior is and is not allowed regarding password management. Unfortunately, manual translation of the policy to this formal language is time consuming and error prone. This work focuses on providing an interface for policy users to generate accurate models of their interpretations of a password policy. This will aid password policy research, formalization, and ultimately more usable password policies. This paper describes the requirements, design, high-level application features, application validation, user testing, and includes a discussion of how this work is expected to progress.",

abstract={Due to the constant evolution of technology, each day brings new programming languages, development paradigms, and ways of evaluating processes. This is no different with source code metrics, where there is always new metric classes. To use a software metric to support decisions, it is necessary to understand how to perform the metric collection, calculation, interpretation, and analysis. The tasks of collecting and calculating source code metrics are most often automated, but how should we monitor them during the software development cycle? Our research aims to assist the software engineer to monitor metrics of vulnerability threats present in the source code through a reference prediction model, considering that real world software have non-functional security requirements, which implies the need to know how to monitor these requirements during the software development cycle. As a first result, this paper presents an empirical study on the evolution of the Linux project. Based on static analysis data, we propose low complexity models to study flaws in the Linux source code. About 391 versions of the project were analyzed by mining the official Linux repository using an approach that can be reproduced to perform similar studies. Our results show that it is possible to predict the number of warnings triggered by a static analyzer for a given software project revision as long as the software is continuously monitored.},
